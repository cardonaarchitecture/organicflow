## Overview

OrganicFlow is a cutting-edge proof-of-concept for a web-based architectural planning application that seamlessly integrates principles of Organic Design and sustainability with advanced technology. This project aims to explore the core functionality and potential integration of key technologies to revolutionize architectural design showcases and workflows.

By harnessing the power of artificial intelligence, 3D visualization, and sustainable design principles, OrganicFlow aspires to transform how architects conceptualize, present, and iterate on their designs. It serves as a bridge between creative vision and technological capability, offering a glimpse into the future of architectural practice.

## Key Features

- üß† **AI-Driven Design Assistance**: Utilizes Groq's advanced language models to provide intelligent design suggestions and optimize spatial layouts.
- üåø **Organic Design Integration**: Incorporates principles of fluidity, adaptability, and harmony with nature into the design process.
- üèóÔ∏è **Interactive 3D Visualization**: Employs Three.js for real-time rendering and manipulation of architectural concepts.
- üîß **Modern Web Architecture**: Built on a robust stack of Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS, ensuring a responsive and intuitive user experience.
- ‚ôªÔ∏è **Sustainability Focus**: Emphasizes eco-friendly materials, energy-efficient designs, and environmental impact assessments.
- üöÄ **Scalable and Extensible**: Designed with a modular architecture to facilitate future enhancements and integrations.
- ü§ù **Collaborative Features**: Enables real-time collaboration and feedback on design projects.

This POC showcases the potential of combining AI, 3D visualization, and sustainable design principles to elevate architectural showcases and streamline the design process. Join us in redefining the boundaries of organic, technology-driven architecture!
